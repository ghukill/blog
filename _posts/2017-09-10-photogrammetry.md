I'm utterly speechless.  And it's due to [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry).

In land far, far away, I was a land surveyor out West.  In those heady times of shooting lasers, I become familiar with the idea of point clouds as representations of physical space in coordinate form.  For our purposes and execution, the resolution of our models were predicated by how many measurements we took.  For a big job, this might be in upwards of 100-200 points.  Imagine hitting the corner of a building, all corners, then a few shots along the sides to confirm that walls weren't billowing, or beams sagging.  14 hours later, you had 100, 200, 300 points in 3-D space that would form a point cloud.

Well, technology marches on.  Sometime in the last 5-7 years, I stumbled on a project called [Photosynth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynth), that offered the ability to upload a series of overlapping photos to create a point cloud but points in the images it determined were shared by 1+ photos.  This was absoluteley jaw-dropping, and it was shortlived.  The project was put forth by Microsoft and the University of Washington, but with the proliferation of quadcopter drones and machine learning, suddenly this technology was highly profitable.

I will keep this short for now, but truly consumer grade software has started to emerge that allow photogrammetry rendition of 3-D models from images.  Some is proprietary software like [Photoscan](http://www.agisoft.com/), but other promising open source options like [OpenDroneMap](http://opendronemap.org/) are hot on their heels.

My first photogrammetric (suffix?) project, a pair of 2+ year old Nikes with more miles than I can count.  A particular fondness I have for old shoes; whom else have been by your side in life moments of small to large like they?  What else propel and project like they do?

I am 100% confident that more of this will be taking place.  In fact, we are soon to meet with someone at Wayne State whom I understand to be doing this very thing for cultural artifacts.  Now, how do we preserve, and provide discovery and access for these beauties...
