What does it all mean?  The connection was entirely lateral, and nigh subconscious.  Listening to Portishead, and suddenly this thought, "what about that guy Tricky?"  

How long until General AI makes those kind of lateral connections, and what vast amount of input would that take?  What is lateral thinking / free-association?

I'm pretty bad at trivia, for the most part, but I'm probably still better than a i5 Intel?
