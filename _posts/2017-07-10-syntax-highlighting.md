I learned today that Jekyll comes with some built-in syntax highlighting when firing through GitHub pages.  So, wanted to take er for a spin...

    def print_reaction(reaction):
        print(reaction)
        
    reaction = "This is amazing!"
    print_reaction(reaction)

I like what I'm seeing.
