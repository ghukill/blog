Recently, I've had the pleasure of sitting through a couple of presentations from special collections cataloging position candidates.  And, participating in the well-known, well-worn post-presentation chats amongst colleagues, grappling with what we just heard, debating the futuristic technologies and standards mentioned.

One framework that keeps coming up is [BIBFRAME](https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/).  I am the first to admit, I am not terribly familiar with BIBFRAME.  BIBFRAME *proper*, that is.  The ideas, technologies, and standards that make up the framework, are another story.  I realized after these presentations that I wanted to educate myself more about the framework, and my stance.
