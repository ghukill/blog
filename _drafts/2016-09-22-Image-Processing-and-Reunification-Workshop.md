## Image Processing and Reunification Workshop


"zooming in as de-familiarizing", Laura Wexler

I recently had the pleasure of attending the [Image Processing and Reunification Workshop](http://archivescollaboratory.umd.edu/image-processing-and-reunification-workshop/) at the University of Maryland, and wanted to pull together some thoughts and notes while it was fresh on the brain.  I can let the workshop's website speak to the actualization of this workshop, buy my thanks and kudos to the two primary organizers [Ricky Punzalan](http://rpunzalan.com/) and [Trevor Mu√±oz](http://trevormunoz.com/) for putting it all together.

I hardly know where to begin.  Maybe with the quote from above, which occured on the last day of the workshop, and work backwards.
