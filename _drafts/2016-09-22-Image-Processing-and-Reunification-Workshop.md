## Image Processing and Reunification Workshop


"zooming in as de-familiarizing", Laura Wexler

I recently had the pleasure of attending the [Image Processing and Reunification Workshop](http://archivescollaboratory.umd.edu/image-processing-and-reunification-workshop/) at the University of Maryland, and wanted to pull together some thoughts and notes while it was fresh on the brain.  I can let the workshop's website speak to the actualization of this workshop, buy my thanks and kudos to the two primary organizers [Ricky Punzalan](http://rpunzalan.com/) and [Trevor Mu√±oz](http://trevormunoz.com/) for putting it all together.

I hardly know where to begin.  Maybe with the quote from above, which occured on the last day of the workshop, and work backwards.

The workshop sought to bring together people from computer vision, humanities scholars, and the Libraries / Archives / Museums (LAM) world, to share understandings around image processing and image reunification.

* What do those terms mean?
* How are they used differently across domains?
* How can computer scientists, humanities scholars, and what I'll refer to here as "digital librarians" collaborate, share and write grants, and otherwise explore these areas together?
* In the words of the workshop programming, **what are the great challenges in each area**?

I came into the workshop thinking it was going to focus on standards like the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](http://iiif.io/), and the digital object repositories like [Fedora Commons](http://fedorarepository.org/) that may serve said images.

In a nutshell, my thinkign that the discussions would take those technologies and standards as the basis for conversation, where quite precisely why I found this workshop to be so helpful and constructive.  Though I understood the diversity of attendees would steer the conversation from here to there and back, I hadn't anticipated that IIIF and the mechanics of image sharing -- which seem so central to image processing and reunification to me -- would be but part of the puzzle.  It's hard to phrase this: I understood there is plenty in this space that do not include the preservation and access of images, but most of my energy _is_ goes towards just that, and a certain tunnel vision creeps in.  This workshop helped me remove those goggles for a moment, and see the role of Libraries, Archives, etc. in the bigger Venn of computer vision, research questions, national and local research agendas, and the like.  This alone, would have left a lasting impression on me.  But there were lovely little, ready for snacking, tidbits as well to be picked up along the way!

In no partiular order, as rusty notes and an even more shoddy memory conjur...
