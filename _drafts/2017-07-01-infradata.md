## Infradata

Stumbled on an interesting concept this morning while sipping coffee in a windowed seat.  But before the topic at hand, "stumbled"?  Good grief.  Perhaps I should say, "while paddling through the dewey, glass-like passages of morning's inlets, I came across a beach..."  Beach, stumbled, semantics.

I stumbled on the concept of *infradata*, while [reading a blog post from Ed Summers on, you guessed it, *infradata*](https://inkdroid.org/2017/05/18/infradata/).  That was 79% of the way into the weaving a few ideas.  This blog post cites [an article by Fidler and Acker](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23660/abstract) that more formally introduces and defines the idea of *infradata*.  Ed's blog post was outlining a neat project about creating a Twitter bot that monitors the structure of the Twitter API response, tweeting changes to the underlying "blueprint" as they occur.  I thought this was interesting at first, but it wasn't until reading more of the Fidler and Acker's article did it click.

So what is *infradata*?  Only one cup of coffee deep into the topic, weaering sunglasses indoors to block the beautiful July 1st sun, I'm about as equipped to summarize as a colander is for pouring water.  But here goes.  In these early glimpses, I get the idea that *infradata* is metadata required by a particular scoped infrastructure to operate.  Said another way, how it strikes me now, it's metadata that serves to represent the current state of objects *in situ* in a given infrastructure.  I love analogies.

### Coat check analogy

My quick and dirty working analogy is a coat check.  When I drop off my coat at a coat check, I'm given a small arrow-shaped piece of paper that says "13" on it.  Then, they hang my coat on rack 3, in room B.  they jot down "rack 3 / room B" on their similar looking ticket that says "13", and file it behind 12, but before 14.  

Okay, I realize this isn't how coat checks work, but a little bit of dramatization and unnecessary complexity makes for a nice, tangible "network" of coats.

My coat is no longer my coat, it is now coat "13".  And it floats listlessly in the sea of coats they have squirreled away.  The only lifeline that the coat has with me, with identity outside of its vapid existence as "coat in coat closet", is the number "13" and the *infradata* that accompanies it.  "13" is the identifier of my *infradata* record, a record which details the precise, and current, location and state of my coat.  Without this bit of information, it's as good as lost.  Without this bit of information, the infrastructure has met its entropic end.  

***To follow up on:** *infradata* or *metadata* as cooling agent in information system imagined as thermodynamic system.*
