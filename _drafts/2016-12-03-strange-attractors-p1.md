A post, in two parts.

## Part 1: Strange Attractors (social)

I recently had the pleasure of driving to Texas and back, and while on the road, partook in some podcasts.  One of them was called, ["Stuff You Should Know"](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts), and dedicated an episode to [Chaos Theory](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-chaos-theory-changed-the-universe.htm).  They did an admirable job with a slippery idea, and while I took away some new insights, this topic was not new to me.

No, I've been a fan / advocate / evagnelist / lunatic / devotee of Chaos Theory since the heady days of 2001.  Early in my undergraduate forays into math and physics, I convinced a professor to let me explore the interesting ramifications of nonlinear and fractal geometry.  Before going any further, if you've searched for "fractal geometry" or even just "fractals" on the internet, you've gotten some websites that looked like they emerged from the 1990's.  You see, the people that love fractals have a *need* to share their insights.  I was firmly in this camp.

I graphed henons in QBASIC, porting code from the appendix of -- gasp -- print books.  I drew sierpinski triangles everywhere.  I used "bifurcate" every chance I could.  It was a wild high, and I chased that tempestuous beast into the darkest of nights.

I became fascinated by coastlines: did you know they are infinitely long?  On a map, the circuitous circumference around an island nation like Iceland may look to be... [~1,000 miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_1_(Iceland))?  But in reality, we can dive into any fjord or inlet, crouch low and begin poking around in the rocks that roll gently in the lapping tides.  Where is the coastline?  Is it before or after that pebble?  If that pebble is included, don't we have to include it in the total distance of the island perimeter?  Yes, you most *certianly* do, as a responsible member of society, a reasonable steward of information.

This leaves us with an uncomfortable truth that "edges" and "boundaries" are often much more complex than we anticipated.  Also revealed from fractal geometery, the same complex gravitational forces that create a valley of flour in your bowl when an egg is cracked into it, are the same that shape the timeless Grand Canyon (at least, many are shared - in all likelihood, your flour valleys have not been whipped by wind and rain for millenia).  But the point remains: brocoli looks like trees, and a bunch of geese flying look suspiciously like reflections of light on lazily undulating waves.

And yet there is so much more to this story, which again, I must commend the hosts of that podcate for nobly wading through, with patience and a singular sense of where they are in the discussion.
