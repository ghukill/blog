I long ago, and far away, had a thousand other blogs, all lost to the sands of time on the internet.  Well, not lost per say, more abandoned as I realized I would not be able to faithfully shepard them along the winding roads of internet time.  My goal was to consolidate here, hunkering down in the welcoming leaves of markdown and GitHub.

In the shuffle, however, I lost a blog I was most fond of, a simple "Word of the Day" or "For the Word", or something along those lines.  It was posts dedicated to a single word, a meditation on the wonderful acorns of knowledge and enshrined history that exist within a single word.  And so, upon reading a word last night that fit the bill, I'd like to bring it back here.  And so, without further ado...

## Ribald

The impetus for blogging about this word can be traced back to a recent trip to Denton, TX to visit an old friend.  While there, we saw the legendary performer Paul Slavens perform.  He takes money from the audience and makes up songs on the spot based on song titles or themes they scribble on bar napkins.

Some estimates have him at more than 2,000 improvised songs in the last 20 years.  So, needless to say, there are plenty of examples on YouTube.  But, despite what you might see in the following video, it's hard to capture his charm and wit that exists between songs; the *real* appeal and virtuoso.

[Wikipedia says this about him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Paul_Slavens),

> "In the mid 90s Slavens began creating improvisational songs based on audience suggestions, and has created an estimated 2000 songs over the last 2 decades, many recordings exist, although few have been released. Often these songs are humorous in nature and can be quite **ribald**."

And such was my (re)acquaintance with **ribald**.  Without any objective definition, I knew precisely what this word meant.  How is that possible?  Moreover, can a definition ever replace this initial correlation of **ribald** that I now hold?
