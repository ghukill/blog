Wonders I, what the Sunday morning holds.  I know that I holds a cup of coffee in one hand (well, it's on the table as I type this).

What is that draw of self-reflective writing?  While others are generating useful content for the world, I'm endlessly intrigued with the workflow.  In fact, it was workflow thinking that occupied my Friday afternoon.

Had the distinct pleasure of attending my 5th or 6th [Mid-Michigan Digital Practioners meeting](https://midmichdp.wordpress.com/).  One of the conversations was about workflows, and I realized I was chomping at the bit to share workflows we've worked on for ingesting objects into our instance of Fedora Commons, our pipelines for running materials through Archivematica and fitting with descriptive metadata from ArchivesSpace, or even just decisions trees for deriving JP2's from TIFFs (with particular thanks to Jon Stoop at Princeton for sharing some of their Kakadu "recipes" [that we've repurposed](https://github.com/WSULib/ouroboros/blob/master/inc/derivatives/image.py#L17-L113)).

When we first set out to replace an aging Digital Collection system with a then unknown platform, it was workflow models that eventually opened our eyes and understanding about Fedora Commons.  I remember [looking at countless diagrams](http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/libsp/61/) of modern digital collections infrastructures, and noticing reocurring components like "Fedora Commons", "Solr", "Blacklight", etc.  This was my preferred way of learning about what's out, what's hot, what's not, what's great, what's old, what's neat, what there is.  What a wonderful way to learn about the world of things by observing their place in a grand workflow diagram.

And so, thinking of beginning a repository of sorts for workflows.  I know this is happening in other areas like the [Portland Common Data Model (PCDM)](https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/wiki), and/or around project Hydra.  I do believe we hone and refine our intuitions about these complex infrastructures by seeing artists's renditions -- and that's what these works of art are.  

To workflows!
