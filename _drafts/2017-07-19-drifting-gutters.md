We've all been there: you've just digitzed a handful of gorgeous books, or equally likely, find yourself in possession of a thousand images, but the digitization resulted in opposing pages as a single image file.  You'd like to ingest these books into your stunning repository and front-end with each page as a seperate image file.  Split each page 50/50 vertically?  Piece of cake?

Think again.  A sneaky side effect of many book scanners, when creating images of opposing pages, is a **drifting gutter** for the book where you'd like to split the page.  This is a result of the aggregate page height on either side of the book shifting as pages are flipped. A 50/50 vertical split across all pages ends with early pages cropping too much from the right-hand page, nice crops around the middle, and left-hand pages overly cropped near the end.
