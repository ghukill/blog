Seemed like a good time to get some thoughts to page on a project I've been working on.  Now that some of scaffolding and ground-leveling is done, it might be a good time to step back and try to put into words what this thing is all about.

In short: a python client for Fedora Commons 4, boringly called [`pyfc4`](https://github.com/ghukill/pyfc4).  In my defense, I've named or worked on projects with some pretty awesome names: [`Ouroboros`](https://github.com/WSULib/ouroboros), a middleware for wrangling the chaos of a digital collections universe; [`ichabod`](https://github.com/WSULib/ichabod), a *headless* browser that rendered pages and used fuzzy matching to determine if the content had changed much; to name a couple.  But this felt like a project that deserved a sane, calm, simple name.

And why's that?  Because `pyfc4`, at best, should get out of your way.
