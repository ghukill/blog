Seemed like a good time to get some thoughts to page on a project I've been working on.  Now that some of scaffolding and ground-leveling is done, it might be a good time to step back and try to put into words what this thing is all about.

In short: a python client for Fedora Commons 4, boringly called [`pyfc4`](https://github.com/ghukill/pyfc4).  In my defense, I've named or worked on projects with some pretty awesome names: [`Ouroboros`](https://github.com/WSULib/ouroboros), a middleware for wrangling the chaos of a digital collections universe; [`ichabod`](https://github.com/WSULib/ichabod), a *headless* browser that rendered pages and used fuzzy matching to determine if the content had changed much; to name a couple.  But this felt like a project that deserved a sane, calm, simple name.

And why's that?  Because `pyfc4`, at best, should get out of your way.  

## Background

Over the past few years, we've built a digital collections platform/infrastructure I'm quite proud of around Fedora Commons 3.x, Solr, and the other usual suspects.  And we did this using primarily python.  The decision to use python was not calculated, other than we had more collective experience with the language at the time, and were blissfully unaware how much work rolling our own middleware would be, as opposed to using other ecosystems like [Hydra (now Samvera)](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera) or [Islandora](https://islandora.ca/), both really excellent and vibrant codebases and communities.
