Seemed like a good time to get some thoughts to page on a project I've been working on.  Now that some of scaffolding and ground-leveling is done, it might be a good time to step back and try to put into words what this thing is all about.

In short: a python client for Fedora Commons 4, boringly called [`pyfc4`](https://github.com/ghukill/pyfc4).  In my defense, I've named or worked on projects with some pretty awesome names: [`Ouroboros`](https://github.com/WSULib/ouroboros), a middleware for wrangling the chaos of a digital collections universe; [`ichabod`](https://github.com/WSULib/ichabod), a *headless* browser that rendered pages and used fuzzy matching to determine if the content had changed much; to name a couple.  But this felt like a project that deserved a sane, calm, simple name.

And why's that?  Because `pyfc4`, at best, should get out of your way.  

## Background

Over the past few years, we've built a digital collections platform/infrastructure I'm quite proud of around Fedora Commons 3.x, Solr, and the other usual suspects.  And we did this using primarily python.  The decision to use python was not calculated, other than we had more collective experience with the language at the time, and were blissfully unaware how much work rolling our own middleware would be, as opposed to using other ecosystems like [Hydra (now Samvera)](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera) or [Islandora](https://islandora.ca/), both really excellent and vibrant codebases and communities.

We knew Fedora was going to be in the mix, but how, how would we communicate with it.  Enter [`eulfedora`](https://github.com/emory-libraries/eulfedora), the phenomenal, intuitive, and powerful python client for Fedora Commons 3.x.  Eulfedora describes itself as:

> eulfedora is a Python module that provides utilities, API wrappers, and classes for interacting with the Fedora-Commons Repository in a pythonic, object-oriented way, with optional Django integration. Current versions of eulfedora are intended for use with Fedora Commons 3.7.x or 3.8.x, but will likely work with earlier versions. If you need support for an earlier version of Fedora and the latest eulfedora does not work, you may have success with the 1.0 release.

> eulfedora.api provides complete access to the Fedora API, primarily making use of Fedora's REST API. This low-level interface is wrapped by eulfedora.server.Repository and eulfedora.models.DigitalObject, which provide a more abstract, object-oriented, and Pythonic way of interacting with a Fedora Repository or with individual objects and datastreams.

> eulfedora.indexdata provides a webservice that returns data for fedora objects in JSON form, which can be used in conjunction with a service for updating an index, such as eulindexer.

> When used with Django, eulfedora can pull the Repository connection configuration from Django settings, and provides a custom management command for loading simple content models and fixture objects to the configured repository.
