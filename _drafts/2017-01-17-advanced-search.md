We're getting into advanced search.  With topic modeling and other alt-metadata searching around the corner, we want to make sure we've got real estate established in the new front-end for the digital collections we've been working on, for unique / beta / interesting / experiemental search options and interfaces.  

So, decided to start wiring up an "advanced search" page to augment our poweful, but relatively simple search page.  Like anything interesting, this candy bar has split higher up than expected, and I'm left chewing much more nougat than anticipated.  Great adventure!
