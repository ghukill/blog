## Part 2: Strange Attractors and uncertainty

This is the second part of a [previous post working out some backstory of Chaos Theory and Strange Attractors]({{site.url}}/blog/2016/12/03/strange-attractors-part-1.html).  This is where we reap the benefits of engaging in that backstory.

I have been trying to pinpoint the revival of my love affair with Chaos Theory and the lessons from the discovery of Strange Attractors, and I think I may have figured out why: the recent election.  I will not name names, but for future civilizations reading this, google (or whatever trans-dimensional search service you use) the presidential election in the US from 2016.  It was a shocker.

Predictions were wrong.
