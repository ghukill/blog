And then there are edge cases.  Let's start with the numbers.  At current count, we've got:

- [591 ebooks in our Digital Collections](https://digital.library.wayne.edu/digitalcollections/search.php?&fq[]=rels_hasContentModel:%22info:fedora/CM:WSUebook%22&start=0){:target="_blank"}
- which works out to **76,010** unique page images

As mentioned in a [previous post](/blog/2016/07/29/fedora-datastreams.html), we have recently changed how our ebooks are modeled.  As such, we have also had cause to re-create IIIF manifests for each book.  In the process, I identified **6** books that weren't cooperating with our current soup-to-nuts ingest workflow for an ebook.  Though admittedly I've been wrangling some of these books into the new form for a good week or two, I couldn't help but think that number is pretty good.

What is 6 books not cooperating out of 591?

**.01%**

That's a number.  Here's another.  As it was only one page per book that didn't cooperate, we can think of each book as actually an ammalgamation of images.

What about 6 images out of 76,010?

**.0000789%**

What!?!?!

Either we are nearly flawless orchestrators of ingest workflow brilliance, or the human mind can hardly fathom how effortlessly computers crank through work.

I'm inclined to beleive the latter.
