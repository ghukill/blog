# The Simple Approach

I'm opting for a simpler blogging experience.

Back in...whenever I switched to Jekyll...it felt like a good idea.  And it probably was at the time!  But this day in age, I'm more interested in an even leaner stack: pure python + HTML.

I want next to zero friction for writing down a thing and having an ability to see it.  I'm pretty happy these days writing 100% markdown, in a text editor.  But I don't even want the layer of something else rendering that on the fly.  Browsers require HTML, so I'll give them HTML!

This post is the first in quite some time, mostly to exercise the machinations.
