<p>So I've been watching the EXCELLENT <a href="http://digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/dcs16.html">Collections as Data 2016</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gcu2GQf7PI&amp;feature=youtu.be">conference live stream</a> all morning, and it's really got the wheels going.</p>
<p>And the wheels were already going.  A few weeks ago -- when I finish corraling my thoughts, perhaps I can link to here -- I attended a workshop in Maryland about Image Processing and Reunification.</p>
<p>These events, and the natural and mysterious evolution of ideas, have conspired to really hit home the idea of <strong>Collections as Data</strong>.</p>
<p>Doesn't stop there.  Thomas Padilla, a former nearby colleague of MSU and now in California I believe, also shared an IMLS grant just yesterday they had funded, "Collections as Data: Conditions of Possibility".</p>
<p>I'm also serving on a committee about academic, R1 library collections.</p>
<p>And there's no end in sight.  </p>
<p>So, collections as data?  What does that mean?  </p>
<p>We do our best here in the Digital Publishing and with our <a href="https://digital.library.wayne.edu/digitalcollections/index.php">Digital Collections</a> to push the envelope of preservation and access, challenging ourselves to align digital objects in ways that will send them flying into the masses outstretch arms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher_pouch">mailbags on passing trains</a>.</p>

<p>If I'm going to bury the lead, might as well throw one more blanket on the pile.  I've also been working on a connector between the <a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/">python ORM Peewee </a> and <a href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables</a> for another project (which I hope to share at some point).  As such, the scary efficient and well-understood mecahnics of a searchable, server-side processing spreadsheet has been on the brain.</p>
<p>So here's the lead:</p>
<h2>What about a spreadsheet-like view for digital collections?</h2>
<p>You get it all.  Thumbnails.  Titles.  Descriptions.  Metadata.  Filtering.  Sorting.  Speed.  Search results already as structured data.  Finesse.  Fireworks.  </p>
<p>Onwards and upwards!  Putting the feelers out for a Solr-DataTables, python based connector, and we're hoping to wire up just such an interface soon for our front-end.</p>
