<h1>The Simple Approach</h1>
<p>I'm opting for a simpler blogging experience.</p>
<p>Back in...whenever I switched to Jekyll...it felt like a good idea.  And it probably was at the time!  But this day in age, I'm more interested in an even leaner stack: pure python + HTML.</p>
<p>I want next to zero friction for writing down a thing and having an ability to see it.  I'm pretty happy these days writing 100% markdown, in a text editor.  But I don't even want the layer of something else rendering that on the fly.  Browsers require HTML, so I'll give them HTML!</p>
<p>This post is the first in quite some time, mostly to exercise the machinations.</p>
