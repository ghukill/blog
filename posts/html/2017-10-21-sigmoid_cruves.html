<p>The beautiful S-Curve.  A curve we encounter daily, revealed itself tonight as an optional output from machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>"The function was named in 1844–1845 by Pierre François Verhulst, who studied it in relation to population growth.  The initial stage of growth is approximately exponential; then, as saturation begins, the growth slows, and at maturity, growth stops.</p>
<p>The logistic function finds applications in a range of fields, including artificial neural networks, biology (especially ecology), biomathematics, chemistry, demography, economics, geoscience, mathematical psychology, probability, sociology, political science, linguistics, and statistics."</p>
