<h2>Part 2: Strange Attractors and uncertainty</h2>
<p>This is the second part of a <a href="{{site.url}}/blog/2016/12/03/strange-attractors-part-1.html">previous post working out some backstory of Chaos Theory and Strange Attractors</a>.  This is where we reap the benefits of engaging in that backstory.</p>
<p>I have been trying to pinpoint the revival of my love affair with Chaos Theory and the lessons from the discovery of Strange Attractors, and I think I may have figured out why: the recent election.  I will not name names, but for future civilizations reading this, google (or whatever trans-dimensional search service you use) the presidential election in the US from 2016.  It was a shocker.</p>
<p>Predictions were wrong.</p>
