<p>And then there are edge cases.  Let's start with the numbers.  At current count, we've got:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://digital.library.wayne.edu/digitalcollections/search.php?&amp;fq[]=rels_hasContentModel:%22info:fedora/CM:WSUebook%22&amp;start=0">591 ebooks in our Digital Collections</a>{:target="_blank"}</li>
<li>which works out to <strong>76,010</strong> unique page images</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned in a <a href="/blog/2016/07/29/fedora-datastreams.html">previous post</a>, we have recently changed how our ebooks are modeled.  As such, we have also had cause to re-create IIIF manifests for each book.  In the process, I identified <strong>6</strong> books that weren't cooperating with our current soup-to-nuts ingest workflow for an ebook.  Though admittedly I've been wrangling some of these books into the new form for a good week or two, I couldn't help but think that number is pretty good.</p>
<p>What is 6 books not cooperating out of 591?</p>
<p><strong>.01%</strong></p>
<p>That's a number.  Here's another.  As it was only one page per book that didn't cooperate, we can think of each book as actually an ammalgamation of images.</p>
<p>What about 6 images out of 76,010?</p>
<p><strong>.0000789%</strong></p>
<p>What!?!?!</p>
<p>Either we are nearly flawless orchestrators of ingest workflow brilliance, or the human mind can hardly fathom how effortlessly computers crank through work.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to beleive the latter.</p>
