<p>Recently, I've had the pleasure of sitting through a couple of presentations from librarian candidates.  And, participating in the well-known, well-worn post-presentation chats amongst colleagues, grappling with what we just heard, debating the futuristic technologies and standards mentioned.</p>
<p>One framework that keeps coming up is <a href="https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/">BIBFRAME</a>.  I am the first to admit, I am not terribly familiar with BIBFRAME proper.  The ideas, technologies, and standards that make up the framework, however, I do have some passing knowledge and experience with.  But I find myself defending a framework I don't know much about, and so wanted to take this opportunity to explore and educate myself about BIBFRAME, such that I might be a champion for it later.</p>
<p>The following is the introductory blurb from the LOC's BIBFRAME website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initiated by the Library of Congress, BIBFRAME provides a foundation for the future of bibliographic description, both on the web, and in the broader networked world...In addition to being a replacement for MARC, BIBFRAME serves as a general model for expressing and connecting bibliographic data. A major focus of the initiative will be to determine a transition path for the MARC 21 formats while preserving a robust data exchange that has supported resource sharing and cataloging cost savings in recent decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't tell us much.  Is it a transfer format or markup language like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>?  Is BIBFRAME a series of cataloguing rules like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_Cataloguing_Rules">Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_and_Access">Resource Description and Access (RDA)</a>?  Just what is this noble beast?</p>
<p>A blurb from the BIBFRAME FAQ suggests it's a bit of everything,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the BIBFRAME Initiative will instantiate a new way to represent and exchange bibliographic data – that is now provided by the Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC) format – its scope is broader. As an initiative, it is investigating all aspects of bibliographic description, data creation, and data exchange. In addition to replacing the MARC format, this includes accommodating different content models and cataloging rules, exploring new methods of data entry, and evaluating current exchange protocols.</p>
