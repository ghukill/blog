<p>I learned today that Jekyll comes with some built-in syntax highlighting when firing through GitHub pages.  So, wanted to take er for a spin...</p>
<p>```python
def print_reaction(reaction):
    print(reaction)</p>
<p>reaction = "This is amazing!"
print_reaction(reaction)
```</p>
<p>I like what I'm seeing.</p>
