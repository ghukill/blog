<h2>Thermal Couplers of Writing</h2>
<p>I'm penning this email with <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a>, as a foray into the worlds of an interface for a static, jekyll GitHub blog.  </p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
<ol>
<li>Authorized prose.io to interact with my GitHub.</li>
<li>Found my blog repository, <em>switched branches</em> with ease.</li>
<li>Clicked "new file" which put me in this editor I now find myself typing.</li>
<li>I like this editor; so far I like it a lot.</li>
<li>In fact, I've been able to preview my writing as I go.</li>
<li>Jekyll keys off of filenaming convetions, and name of this file / post was conveniently started for me.  I rue typing YYYY-DD-MM, my fingers simply can't do it.</li>
<li>And now, I'm hoping that clicking the adorable save icon in the corner will save this markdown file to my blog repository, and thus, publish this "post".</li>
</ol>
<p>If these writings to not ever make it to the Internet, may their voyage into <code>/dev/null</code> be quick(?) and painless.</p>
<p>If, however, they do find their way to a blog posting, then consider me tickled.  I might end up using this for impromptu, tidy, enjoyable writing.</p>
<p>And here's a picture for good measure:</p>
