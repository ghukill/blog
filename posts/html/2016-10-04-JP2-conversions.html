<p>Wanted to share a couple of hilarious and haunting images from creating and converting JP2s with the <a href="http://kakadusoftware.com/">Kakadu JPEG2000 library</a>.  Full disclaimer: it is not the fault of Kakadu, it is most likely our free-wheeling, high-octane JP2 conversion approach we had in the pipeline for awhile.</p>
<p>Kakadu allows for tasks to get run over multiple processes, this is good!  We also run these JP2 conversions with <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery, a background task infrastructure for Python</a>.  It is also not Celery's fault.  Finally, we're queuing up multiple images for this pixel gauntlet.  That, is most assuredly our fault.  </p>
<p>The result, some pretty wild images.  They are usually the combination of tiles and pixels from pictures nearby on the processing pipeline, at least that's my working theory for now.</p>
